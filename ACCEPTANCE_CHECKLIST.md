## Final Verification Steps

### Step 1: Local Development Test
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd celestia

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services healthy
docker-compose ps
# Expected: All services "Up" and "healthy"

# Verify backend
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok",...}

# Check database
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U celestia -d celestia_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM horoscopes;"
# Expected: 360 rows (after seeding)
```

### Step 2: Mobile App Test
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
expo start

# Test on iOS simulator: Press 'i'
# Test on Android emulator: Press 'a'
# Test on physical device: Scan QR code

# Expected: App launches, shows onboarding or home screen
```

### Step 3: API Test
```bash
# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test1234!","nickname":"Tester","birthdate":"1990-01-15","timezone":"UTC"}'

# Expected: User created with JWT token

# Get today's horoscope
curl http://localhost:3000/api/horoscope/today?sign=capricorn \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

# Expected: Today's horoscope for Capricorn
```

### Step 4: Test Suite
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Expected: All tests pass

# Mobile tests
cd ../mobile
npm test

# Expected: All tests pass
```

### Step 5: Content Validation
```bash
# Validate horoscope structure
node -e "
const data = require('./horoscopes_month1.json');
console.log('Total entries:', data.length);
console.log('Expected: 360');
console.log('Has probabilistic language:', 
  data.every(h => /may|might|could|possible|perhaps/i.test(h.content))
);
"

# Expected: 360 entries, all with probabilistic language
```

### Step 6: Security Check
```bash
# Check for secrets in code
grep -r "password.*=.*['\"]" backend/src/
grep -r "api.*key.*=.*['\"]" backend/src/

# Expected: No matches (secrets should be in .env only)

# Run npm audit
cd backend && npm audit --audit-level=high
cd ../mobile && npm audit --audit-level=high

# Expected: No high or critical vulnerabilities
```

## Sign-Off

**Acceptance Criteria Met**: ✅ All items checked

**Ready for**:
- [x] Local development and testing
- [x] Code review
- [x] QA testing
- [x] Security audit
- [x] Beta testing
- [x] Production deployment (after completing launch checklist)

**Known Limitations**:
- Crisis hotline numbers are placeholders (must be populated before launch)
- Mental health escalation copy should be reviewed by licensed professional
- Distress detection algorithm may need tuning based on real-world usage
- Content for months 2-12 needs to be generated
- App store assets (screenshots, icons) need design
- Legal documents (privacy policy, terms) need lawyer review

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Week 1-2 items in LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md
2. Engage mental health consultant to review safety features
3. Engage legal counsel to review privacy documentation
4. Create app store assets (icons, screenshots, descriptions)
5. Generate content for months 2-3
6. Recruit beta testers
7. Configure production infrastructure
8. Complete security audit

**Project Status**: ✅ **DELIVERABLES COMPLETE**

All required artifacts have been created and are functional. The system is ready for development, testing, and refinement before production launch.
